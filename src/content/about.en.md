Hi I'm Elmar, I'm 23 years old and I live in Rotterdam.
When I was twelve I wanted to make my own games and that's where my passion for programming started.
Now that I'm 23 years old, making games has been replaced by developing and designing web apps and websites.

Currently I am working at Turff as lead front-end developer and I have developed apps such as:

- the Turff webshop in Next.js
- a dashboard in vue 3
- a UI library with 50+ components also in vue 3

But what I like to do most is Typescript and making end-2-end typesafe apps (and I still have a girlfriend ðŸ˜‰)
